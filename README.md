Solution to I Heart Media Scala code challenge

### Issues ###
These do not work

- `import java.time.LocalDateTime`
- `import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit`

and generate errors like 

`error: object time is not a member of package java`

Meanwhile, I should probably not be using time anyway, but a msec counter instead
